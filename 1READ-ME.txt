Open the 2start.bat using Notepad.

Please note as Rubix RBX was the first to use Wish (bmw512) this miner uses a "rubix" flag
to select the Wish algo mining thread. (e.g. -a rubix)

You should see: 
cpuminer.exe -a rubix -o http://127.0.0.1:18094/ -u yourRPCusername -p yourRPCpassword -t 1

-t selects how many cores you would like to dedicate to mining. In this example we have one.
Edit the RPCusername and RPCpassword sections to match your conif file contents.

Save

now start the 2start.bat

Mining will begin
